# Phobetor

> A chrome extension to record your actions into a [nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) script.

## Example

![Demo](http://f.cl.ly/items/2S3a3P2a1u3r1Z1I1y3f/screenshot.png)

## Installing
### Google Chrome

1. Run `$ git clone https://github.com/blacklocus/phobetor.git && cd phobetor && make`
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Ensure that 'Developer mode' is checked
4. Click `Load unpacked extension...`
5. Browse to `phobetor/build` and click `Select`

## Usage

Just click the black recording icon (it should turn green to indicate that it is actively recording), run all the tasks you wish to automate, and then click the green icon and open the popup.

## Notes

Phobetor currently supports `.goto()`, `.click()`, `.type()`, `.screenshot()`, and `.refresh()`.

If you want phobetor to capture typing, press <kbd>tab</kbd> after you finish typing in each `input` element.

## Analytics

Phobetor uses the [analytics-node](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-node) library for analytics tracking. Here's an example of how you can add analytics to your own chrome extension:

```js
var Analytics = require('analytics-node');
var analytics = new Analytics('YOUR_WRITE_KEY');

var languages = window.navigator.languages;
var version = chrome.app.getDetails().version;

analytics.identify({ userId: '12345', version: version, languages: languages });
analytics.track({ userId: '12345', event: 'Opened Popup' });
```
